  abstract = {The Bay of Bengal (BoB) region is under severe threat of marine pollution because of unsustainable management of human activities for the exploration of marine resources. The emergence of the concept of Blue Economy fuels the coastal states to explore more marine resources that will cause much more marine pollution in the region. Therefore, a balance between the exploration and conservation of marine resources is essential for the prevention of unsustainable use and marine pollution. Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) may be a tool for the balance between exploration and conservation of the marine resources in the BoB region. This balance approach will also facilitate to develop a sustainable Blue Economy for the coastal states of the Bay region through sustainable management and use of the marine resources. However, the current regional legal arrangements for management of ocean resources of the BoB do not provide any explicit provisions for the development of MSP in the Bay region. The current regional conventions, agreements, declarations, organisations, programmes and plans have different provisions for management of the marine resources of the BoB. Those legal regimes have several provisions that are relevant and cover different aspects of MSP. However, the current regional arrangements for the management of marine resources are not adequate for the development of MSP for sustainable use and prevention of marine pollution in the BoB. This inadequacy has significantly impacted the objective of sustainable Blue Economy in the Bay region. A uniform agreement among the coastal states is essential to develop a regional MSP in the BoB region. Development of MSP in the BoB will be an effective tool for greening the Blue Economy by sustainable use and protection of the marine environment in the Bay region.},

  abstract = {Standardized oil toxicity testing is important to ensure comparability of study results, and to generate information to support oil spill planning, response, and environmental assessments. Outcomes from toxicity tests are useful in the development, improvement and validation of effects models, and new or revised knowledge could be integrated into existing databases and related tools. To foster transparency, facilitate repeatability and maximize use and impact, outcomes from toxicity tests need to be clearly reported and communicated. This work is part of a series of reviews to support the modernization of the ``Chemical Response to Oil Spills: Ecological Effects Research Forum'' protocols focusing on technological advances and best toxicity testing practices. Thus, the primary motivation of the present work is to provide guidance and encourage detailed documentation of aquatic toxicity studies. Specific recommendations are provided regarding key reporting elements (i.e., experimental design, test substance and properties, test species and response endpoints, media preparation, exposure conditions, chemical characterization, reporting metric corresponding to the response endpoint, data quality standards, and statistical methods, and raw data), which along with a proposed checklist can be used to assess the completeness of reporting elements or to guide study conduct. When preparing journal publications, authors are encouraged to take advantage of the Supplementary Material section to enhance dissemination and access to key data and information that can be used by multiple end-users, including decision-makers, scientific support staff and modelers. Improving reporting, science communication, and access to critical information enable users to assess the reliability and relevance of study outcomes and increase incorporation of results gleaned from toxicity testing into tools and applications that support oil spill response decisions. Furthermore, improved reporting could be beneficial for audiences outside the oil spill response community, including peer reviewers, journal editors, aquatic toxicologists, researchers in other disciplines, and the public.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACTThe Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill was the largest accidental release of crude oil into the sea in history, and represents the most extensive use of chemical dispersants to treat an oil spill. Following the spill, extensive studies were conducted to determine the potential acute and sublethal toxic effects of crude oil and dispersants on a range of planktonic, nektonic, and benthic marine organisms. Organisms such as phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fish were examined via controlled laboratory studies, while others, such as deep-sea benthic invertebrates, which are difficult to sample, maintain, and study in the laboratory, were assessed through field studies. Laboratory studies with marine fishes focused on the sublethal effects of oil and dispersants, and early life history stages were generally found to be more sensitive to these toxins than adults. Field studies in the vicinity of the DWH spill indicate a significant reduction in abundance and diversity of benthic meiofauna and macrofauna as well as visual damage to deep-sea corals. Overall, studies indicate that while the responses of various marine species to oil and dispersants are quite variable, a general picture is emerging that chemical dispersants may be more toxic to some marine organisms than previously thought, and that small oil droplets created by dispersant use and directly consumed by marine organisms are often more toxic than crude oil alone.},

However, development of infrastructure in the marine environment presents risks to wildlife. Marine birds in particular have life history traits that amplify population impacts from displacement and collision with offshore wind infrastructure. Here, we present a broadly applicable framework to assess and mitigate the impacts of OWED on marine birds. We outline existing techniques to quantify impact via monitoring and modeling (e.g., collision risk models, population viability analysis), and present a robust mitigation framework to avoid, minimize, or compensate for OWED impacts. Our framework addresses impacts within the context of multiple stressors across multiple wind energy developments. We also present technological and methodological approaches that can improve impact estimation and mitigation. We highlight compensatory mitigation as a tool that can be incorporated into regulatory frameworks to mitigate impacts that cannot be avoided or minimized via siting decisions or alterations to OWED infrastructure or operation. Our framework is intended as a globally-relevant approach for assessing and mitigating OWED impacts on marine birds that may be adapted to existing regulatory frameworks in regions with existing or planned OWED.},

The resulting dataset encompasses 663 taxonomic groups (at Family or higher taxonomic rank) ranging from microorganisms to mammals. We inferred changes in the composition of communities, revealing putative interactions among taxa and identifying correlations between these communities and environmental properties over time. Community network analysis provided evidence of expected predator-prey relationships, trophic linkages, and seasonal shifts across all domains of life.

  abstract = {Gulf of Mexico ecosystems are interconnected by numerous physical and biological processes. As a result of the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) spill, some normal ecological processes including resource connectivity and trophic interactions and were damaged or broken. A considerable portion of post-DWH research has focused on higher levels of biological organization (i.e., populations, communities, and ecosystems) spanning at least four environments (onshore, coastal, open ocean, and deep benthos). Damage wrought by the oil spill and mitigation efforts varied considerably across ecosystems. Whereas all systems show prolonged impacts because of cascading effects that impacted functional connections within and between communities, deep-sea and mesopelagic environments were particularly hard hit and have shown less resilience than shallow environments. In some environments, such as marshes or the deep-sea benthos, products from the spill are still biologically accessible. Some shallow ecosystems show signs of recovery, and populations of some species show resilience; however, a return to a ``pre-spill'' state is questionable. Importantly, habitats in which large amounts of energy flow through the ecosystem (marshes, coastal regions) recovered more quickly than low energy habitats (deep-sea benthos). Functional interactions between Gulf of Mexico systems are more complex and widespread than generally recognized. Moreover, ecosystems in the Gulf are subject to multiple stressors that can combine to impart greater, and less predictable, impacts. To help mitigate the effects of future insults, we identify four salient areas of research that should be addressed for each of the major environments within the Gulf of Mexico: establishing monitoring systems; quantifying coupling between Gulf ecosystems; developing criteria for assessing the ``vulnerability'' and ``resilience'' of species, communities, and ecosystems; and developing holistic predictive modeling.},

Using long-term hindcast winds and ocean currents, the OSRA model generates hundreds of thousands of trajectories from hypothetical oil spill locations and derives the probability of contact to these environmental resources in the U.S. OCS. This study generates probability of oil spill contact maps by initiating trajectories from hypothetical oil spill points over the entire planning areas in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (GOM) OCS and tabulating the contacts over the entire waters in the GOM. Therefore, a probability of oil spill contact database that stores information of the spill points and contacts can be created for a given set of wind and current data such that the probability of oil spill contact to any environmental resources from future leasing areas can be estimated without a rerun of the OSRA model. The method can be applied to other OCS regions and help improve BOEM's decision-making process.},

This review provides examples of various documented impacts, common patterns, and trends across organisms and/or their environments, and discusses future implications as well as directions for future research. Organism effects are generally characterized as lethal and sublethal. Sublethal can be short term, long term, or permanent and multigenerational. We present individual examples of effects on behavioral response, olfaction, vision, cardiac function, and gene shift, based on research done in laboratories, mesocosm settings, and the field. Future research should emphasize collection and analysis of routine toxicological baselines and examine how and if molecular impacts cascade up to populations. This research will require development of rapid molecular tools and testing procedures to determine exposure compared to field-relevant exposure levels and to be able to extrapolate laboratory results to the field, especially given the mosaic of differing contaminant concentrations (below, at, or exceeding critical concentrations that result in lethal or sublethal effects) occurring in the environment. Recent chemical studies have identified a detectable suite of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolites for which there are no toxicity data; further research is needed to determine their impacts on food webs.},

  abstract = {The 2010 Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) was the largest and perhaps most consequential accidental marine oil spill in global history. This paper provides an overview of a Research Topic consisting of four additional papers that: (1) assemble time series data for ecosystem components in regions impacted by the spill, and (2) interpret temporal changes related to the vulnerability of species and ecosystems to DWH and the ensuing resilience to perturbation. Time series abundance data for many taxa pre-date DWH, often by decades, thus allowing an assessment of population- and community-level impacts. We divided the north central GoM into four interconnected ``eco-types'': the coastal/nearshore, continental shelf, open-ocean pelagic and deep benthic. Key taxa in each eco-type were evaluated for their vulnerability to the circumstances of the DWH spill based on population overlap with oil, susceptibility to oil contamination, and other factors, as well their imputed resilience to population-level impacts, based on life history metrics, ecology and post-spill trajectories. Each taxon was scored as low, medium, or high for 13 vulnerability attributes and 11 resilience attributes to produce overall vulnerability and resilience scores, which themselves were also categorical (i.e., low, medium, or high). The resulting taxon-specific V-R scores provide important guidance on key species to consider and monitor in the event of future spills similar to DWH. Similar analyses may also guide resource allocation to collect baseline data on highly vulnerable taxa or those with low resilience potential in other ecosystems. For some species, even a decade of observation has been insufficient to document recovery given chronic, long-term exposure to DWH oil remaining in all eco-types and because of impacts to the reproductive output of long-lived species. Due to the ongoing threats of deep-water blowouts, continued surveillance of populations affected by DWH is warranted to document long-term recovery or change in system state. The level of population monitoring in the open-ocean and deep benthic eco-types has historically been low and is inconsistent with the continued migration of the oil industry to the ultra-deep ({$\geq$}1,500 m) where the majority of leasing, exploration, and production now occurs.},

This paper aims to study the planning for the R\&D of RERs in order to avoid bottlenecks and ensure sustainable development in developing marine economies. We have established a triple difference model (DDD) model and a wise pig game model between the theoretical government and enterprise. The data on RERs come from the World Bank and International Energy Agency databases. We have three contributions on the basis of distinguishing between mature and immature marine RERs technologies. First, it emphasizes the importance of developing R\&D planning for marine RERs immature technology in the future. Second, the DDD model is used to empirically establish whether RERs planning has a significant positive impact on RERs' output, which explains the importance of existing RERs planning. Third, the wise pig game model is used to analyze the welfare benefits to the government brought by the R\&D planning of marine RERs which proves the importance of future RERs R\&D planning.}

  abstract = {This study develops and implements an interdisciplinary framework to provide a holistic examination of the potential for tidal stream turbines (TST) to displace diesel generated electricity in remote coastal First Nations communities in British Columbia. In doing so it seeks to answer the following research questions: what is the distribution of practical tidal resources in the study region, for which communities is tidal energy a potentially viable electricity source, and what are the benefits and challenges of TST development. GIS Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis and interviews with high level marine spatial planning decision makers are used to identify practical resource sites, bridge knowledge gaps, assess views towards TST development, and understand the desired characteristics of community energy systems. Additional techno-economic criteria for tidal site identification are included to identify communities that may be candidates for TST integration. Results illustrate the need for information provision to communities from resource quantification to characteristics of renewable energy technologies; self sufficiency as being the primary electrification driver; and funding/human resource capacity as being substantial barriers to development. Approximately 89.8~km2 of practical tidal resource is identified, with {$\approx$}21.9~km2 of techno-economically feasible practical resource in proximity to nine communities. Four communities appear to be promising candidates for tidal development, and overall results indicate significant interest within the study region for TST development. The interdisciplinary framework presented here provides a methodology that can be adapted and implemented in other jurisdictions to identify practical resources and incorporate social dimensions into MRE decision making.},

However, the collision of birds and bats with wind turbines is widely recognized as a negative environmental impact of wind farms. Collisions with either the static structure or the rotating blades of the wind turbines occur. This project memo provides a review of technology for bird detection and collision prevention, focusing on post-construction minimization measures. Initially, an overview of sensor technologies commonly used to detect birds in the vicinity of wind farms, namely radar and camera-based systems, is presented. Then, four minimization measures including experimental tests at different wind farms worldwide are described: habitat management and painting (categorized as passive measures), and turbine curtailment and deterrents (categorized as active measures, as they require information from an external source to trigger an action for collision avoidance). Advantages and disadvantages of the measures are discussed throughout the document.},
