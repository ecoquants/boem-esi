  abstract = {The Bay of Bengal (BoB) region is under severe threat of marine pollution because of unsustainable management of human activities for the exploration of marine resources. The emergence of the concept of Blue Economy fuels the coastal states to explore more marine resources that will cause much more marine pollution in the region. Therefore, a balance between the exploration and conservation of marine resources is essential for the prevention of unsustainable use and marine pollution. Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) may be a tool for the balance between exploration and conservation of the marine resources in the BoB region. This balance approach will also facilitate to develop a sustainable Blue Economy for the coastal states of the Bay region through sustainable management and use of the marine resources. However, the current regional legal arrangements for management of ocean resources of the BoB do not provide any explicit provisions for the development of MSP in the Bay region. The current regional conventions, agreements, declarations, organisations, programmes and plans have different provisions for management of the marine resources of the BoB. Those legal regimes have several provisions that are relevant and cover different aspects of MSP. However, the current regional arrangements for the management of marine resources are not adequate for the development of MSP for sustainable use and prevention of marine pollution in the BoB. This inadequacy has significantly impacted the objective of sustainable Blue Economy in the Bay region. A uniform agreement among the coastal states is essential to develop a regional MSP in the BoB region. Development of MSP in the BoB will be an effective tool for greening the Blue Economy by sustainable use and protection of the marine environment in the Bay region.},

  abstract = {Standardized oil toxicity testing is important to ensure comparability of study results, and to generate information to support oil spill planning, response, and environmental assessments. Outcomes from toxicity tests are useful in the development, improvement and validation of effects models, and new or revised knowledge could be integrated into existing databases and related tools. To foster transparency, facilitate repeatability and maximize use and impact, outcomes from toxicity tests need to be clearly reported and communicated. This work is part of a series of reviews to support the modernization of the ``Chemical Response to Oil Spills: Ecological Effects Research Forum'' protocols focusing on technological advances and best toxicity testing practices. Thus, the primary motivation of the present work is to provide guidance and encourage detailed documentation of aquatic toxicity studies. Specific recommendations are provided regarding key reporting elements (i.e., experimental design, test substance and properties, test species and response endpoints, media preparation, exposure conditions, chemical characterization, reporting metric corresponding to the response endpoint, data quality standards, and statistical methods, and raw data), which along with a proposed checklist can be used to assess the completeness of reporting elements or to guide study conduct. When preparing journal publications, authors are encouraged to take advantage of the Supplementary Material section to enhance dissemination and access to key data and information that can be used by multiple end-users, including decision-makers, scientific support staff and modelers. Improving reporting, science communication, and access to critical information enable users to assess the reliability and relevance of study outcomes and increase incorporation of results gleaned from toxicity testing into tools and applications that support oil spill response decisions. Furthermore, improved reporting could be beneficial for audiences outside the oil spill response community, including peer reviewers, journal editors, aquatic toxicologists, researchers in other disciplines, and the public.},

  abstract = {Although offshore wind energy development (OWED) offers a much-needed renewable energy alternative to fossil fuels, holistic and effective methods for evaluating environmental impacts on wildlife in both space and time have been lacking. The lengthy environmental compliance process, estimated to incur a 7\textendash 10 year permitting timeline [1], has been identified as a significant impediment to offshore energy development in U.S. waters. During operation, seabirds can collide and be displaced by turbines. During episodic pre-operation phases, cetaceans are most heavily impacted acoustically by pile driving (and similarly seismic air gun surveys for oil and gas exploration). The varying nature of impacts in space and time leads us to conclude that sites should be selected in space to minimize long-term operational impacts on seabirds, and timing of surveying and construction activities to be conducted in times of the year when sensitive migratory marine mammals are least present. We developed a novel spatiotemporal decision support framework that interactively visualizes tradeoffs between OWED industry profits and wildlife sensitivities, in both space and time. The framework highlights sites on a map that are the most profitable and least sensitive to seabirds. Within the U.S. Mid-Atlantic study area, the New York Call Areas are particularly well optimized for minimal impact on seabirds with maximal profits to OWED. For a given site, pre-operational activities (e.g. pile driving and seismic air gun surveying) are advised by cetacean sensitivity across months of the year that minimize impacts on migratory cetaceans, particularly those of highest conservation concern such as the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena Glacialis). For instance, within optimal sites for the New York Call Area the least impacting months are May and June. Other taxa are certainly affected by OWED and should be incorporated into this framework, but data on their distributions and/or sensitivities is currently less well known. Built with open-source software made publicly available, the authors hope this framework will be extended even more comprehensively into the future as our knowledge on species distributions and OWED sensitivities expands for streamlining environmental compliance.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACTThe Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill was the largest accidental release of crude oil into the sea in history, and represents the most extensive use of chemical dispersants to treat an oil spill. Following the spill, extensive studies were conducted to determine the potential acute and sublethal toxic effects of crude oil and dispersants on a range of planktonic, nektonic, and benthic marine organisms. Organisms such as phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fish were examined via controlled laboratory studies, while others, such as deep-sea benthic invertebrates, which are difficult to sample, maintain, and study in the laboratory, were assessed through field studies. Laboratory studies with marine fishes focused on the sublethal effects of oil and dispersants, and early life history stages were generally found to be more sensitive to these toxins than adults. Field studies in the vicinity of the DWH spill indicate a significant reduction in abundance and diversity of benthic meiofauna and macrofauna as well as visual damage to deep-sea corals. Overall, studies indicate that while the responses of various marine species to oil and dispersants are quite variable, a general picture is emerging that chemical dispersants may be more toxic to some marine organisms than previously thought, and that small oil droplets created by dispersant use and directly consumed by marine organisms are often more toxic than crude oil alone.},

The resulting dataset encompasses 663 taxonomic groups (at Family or higher taxonomic rank) ranging from microorganisms to mammals. We inferred changes in the composition of communities, revealing putative interactions among taxa and identifying correlations between these communities and environmental properties over time. Community network analysis provided evidence of expected predator-prey relationships, trophic linkages, and seasonal shifts across all domains of life.

  abstract = {Offshore wind farms are rapidly being permitted along the East Coast of the US, and with subsequent development could cumulatively affect seabird populations. Yet, the seabird guilds most likely at risk of cumulative effects have not been identified. Assessments of cumulative effects must first calculate the cumulative exposure of seabirds to areas suitable for offshore wind farms and then estimate how exposure will affect populations. This paper addresses this first need, and quantifies how three different wind farm siting scenarios could cumulatively expose seven seabird foraging guilds. The coastal bottom gleaner guild (sea ducks) would be exposed at similar rates regardless of siting decision, while other coastal guilds would be exposed at a higher rate when projects are built in shallow areas and close to shore rather than in high-wind areas. The pelagic seabird guild would be exposed at high rates when projects are built in high-wind areas. There was no single offshore wind siting scenario that reduced the cumulative exposure for all guilds. Based upon these findings, we identify the foraging guilds most likely to be cumulatively exposed and propose an approach for siting and mitigation that may reduce cumulative exposure for all guilds.},

Assessments of cumulative effects must first calculate the cumulative exposure of a wildlife population to a hazard and then estimate how the exposure will affect the population. Our research responds to the first need by developing a model designed to assess how different wind farm siting scenarios cumulatively expose wildlife. The model assesses cumulative exposure by identifying all locations where development could occur, placing wind farms within this suitability layer, and then overlaying wind engineering and biological data sets. The first model output is a graphical representation of how offshore wind farm siting decisions affect wildlife cumulative exposure. The second output is an index that ranks which offshore wind farm siting decisions will have the greatest influence on wildlife cumulative exposure. Together these outputs provide stakeholders with valuable information that could be used to guide siting and management decisions.},

  abstract = {Gulf of Mexico ecosystems are interconnected by numerous physical and biological processes. As a result of the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) spill, some normal ecological processes including resource connectivity and trophic interactions and were damaged or broken. A considerable portion of post-DWH research has focused on higher levels of biological organization (i.e., populations, communities, and ecosystems) spanning at least four environments (onshore, coastal, open ocean, and deep benthos). Damage wrought by the oil spill and mitigation efforts varied considerably across ecosystems. Whereas all systems show prolonged impacts because of cascading effects that impacted functional connections within and between communities, deep-sea and mesopelagic environments were particularly hard hit and have shown less resilience than shallow environments. In some environments, such as marshes or the deep-sea benthos, products from the spill are still biologically accessible. Some shallow ecosystems show signs of recovery, and populations of some species show resilience; however, a return to a ``pre-spill'' state is questionable. Importantly, habitats in which large amounts of energy flow through the ecosystem (marshes, coastal regions) recovered more quickly than low energy habitats (deep-sea benthos). Functional interactions between Gulf of Mexico systems are more complex and widespread than generally recognized. Moreover, ecosystems in the Gulf are subject to multiple stressors that can combine to impart greater, and less predictable, impacts. To help mitigate the effects of future insults, we identify four salient areas of research that should be addressed for each of the major environments within the Gulf of Mexico: establishing monitoring systems; quantifying coupling between Gulf ecosystems; developing criteria for assessing the ``vulnerability'' and ``resilience'' of species, communities, and ecosystems; and developing holistic predictive modeling.},

Since the 1970s, BOEM has developed and applied the OSRA model to evaluate the risk of potential oil spills to environmental resources. This paper summarizes some of the OSRA model progress and applications in the past decade: (1) calculation of the risk of catastrophic oil spills (with a volume over one million barrels), which concludes that the return period of a catastrophic oil spill in OCS areas is estimated to be 165 years; (2) a more efficient way to estimate the probability of oil spill contact to environmental resources in the Gulf of Mexico; (3) weathering calculations in OSRA, which enhances the accuracy of the OSRA model results; and (4) application of OSRA to the Ixtoc I oil spill as an example of how the OSRA model simulates large oil spills for oil spill preparedness and response.},

As an alternative, we developed an ecological niche model to map global distributions of 115 cetacean and pinniped species living in the marine environment using more readily available expert knowledge about habitat usage. We started by assigning each species to broad-scale niche categories with respect to depth, sea-surface temperature, and ice edge association based on synopses of published information. Within a global information system framework and a global grid of 0.5\textdegree{} latitude/longitude cell dimensions, we then generated an index of the relative environmental suitability (RES) of each cell for a given species by relating known habitat usage to local environmental conditions. RES predictions closely matched published maximum ranges for most species, thus representing useful, more objective alternatives to existing sketched distributional outlines. In addition, raster-based predictions provided detailed information about heterogeneous patterns of potentially suitable habitat for species throughout their range. We tested RES model outputs for 11 species (northern fur seal, harbor porpoise, sperm whale, killer whale, hourglass dolphin, fin whale, humpback whale, blue whale, Antarctic minke, and dwarf minke whales) from a broad taxonomic and geographic range, using data from dedicated surveys. Observed encounter rates and species-specific predicted environmental suitability were significantly and positively correlated for all but 1 species. In comparison, encounter rates were correlated with {$<$}1\% of 1000 simulated random data sets for all but 2 species. Mapping of large-scale marine mammal distributions using this environmental envelope model is helpful for evaluating current assumptions and knowledge about species' occurrences, especially for data-poor species. Moreover, RES modeling can help to focus research efforts on smaller geographic scales and usefully supplement other, statistical, habitat suitability models.},

Here we present the first assessment of marine bird vulnerability to potential OWEI in the California Current System portion of the U.S. Pacific Outer Continental Shelf (POCS). Using population size, demography, life history, flight heights, and avoidance behavior for 62 seabird and 19 marine water bird species that occur in the POCS, we present and apply equations to calculate Population Vulnerability, Collision Vulnerability, and Displacement Vulnerability to OWEI for each species. Species with greatest Population vulnerability included those listed as species of concern (e.g., Least Tern [Sternula antillarum], Marbled Murrelet [Brachyramphus marmoratus], Pink-footed Shearwater [Puffinus creatopus]) and resident year-round species with small population sizes (e.g., Ashy Storm-Petrel [Oceanodroma homochroa], Brandt's Cormorant [Phalacrocorax penicillatus], and Brown Pelican [Pelecanus occidentalis]). Species groups with the greatest Collision Vulnerability included jaegers/skuas, pelicans, terns and gulls that spend significant amounts of time flying at rotor sweep zone height and don't show macro-avoidance behavior (avoidance of entire OWEI area). Species groups with the greatest Displacement Vulnerability show high macro-avoidance behavior and low habitat flexibility and included loons, grebes, sea ducks, and alcids. Using at-sea survey data from the southern POCS, we combined species-specific vulnerabilities described above with at-sea species densities to assess vulnerabilities spatially. Spatial vulnerability densities were greatest in areas with high species densities (e.g., near-shore areas) and locations where species with high vulnerability were found in abundance. Our vulnerability assessment helps understand and minimize potential impacts of OWEI infrastructure on marine birds in the POCS and could inform management decisions.},

Using long-term hindcast winds and ocean currents, the OSRA model generates hundreds of thousands of trajectories from hypothetical oil spill locations and derives the probability of contact to these environmental resources in the U.S. OCS. This study generates probability of oil spill contact maps by initiating trajectories from hypothetical oil spill points over the entire planning areas in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (GOM) OCS and tabulating the contacts over the entire waters in the GOM. Therefore, a probability of oil spill contact database that stores information of the spill points and contacts can be created for a given set of wind and current data such that the probability of oil spill contact to any environmental resources from future leasing areas can be estimated without a rerun of the OSRA model. The method can be applied to other OCS regions and help improve BOEM's decision-making process.},

  abstract = {The northern Gulf of Mexico (nGoM) is a globally important region for oil extraction and supports a diverse assemblage of marine birds. Due to their frequent contact with surface waters, diverse foraging strategies, and the ease with which oil adheres to feathers, seabirds are particularly susceptible to hydrocarbon contamination. Given the chronic and acute exposure of seabirds to oiling and a lack of studies that focus on the exposure of seabirds to oiling in sub-tropical and tropical regions, a greater understanding of the vulnerability of seabirds to oil in the nGoM appears warranted. We present an oil vulnerability index for seabirds in the nGoM tailored to the current state of knowledge using new, spatiotemporally expensive vessel-based seabird observations. We use information on the exposure and sensitivity of seabirds to oil to rank seabird vulnerability. Exposure variables characterized the potential to encounter oil and gas (O\&G). Sensitivity variables characterized the potential impact of seabirds interacting with O\&G and are related to life history and productivity. We also incorporated uncertainty in each variable, identifying data gaps. We found that the percent of seabirds' habitat defined as highly suitable within 10~km of an O\&G platform ranged from 0\%-65\% among 24 species. Though O\&G platforms only overlap with 15\% of highly suitable seabird habitat, overlap occurs in areas of moderate to high vulnerability of seabirds, particularly along the shelf-slope. Productivity-associated sensitivity variables were primarily responsible for creating the gradient in vulnerability scores and had greater uncertainty than exposure variables. Highly vulnerable species (e.g., Northern gannet (Morus bassanus)) tended to have high exposure to the water surface via foraging behaviors (e.g., plunge-diving), older age at first breeding, and an extended incubating and fledging period compared to less vulnerable species (e.g., Pomarine jaeger (Stercorarius pomarinus)). Uncertainty related to productivity could be reduced through at-colony monitoring. Strategic seabird satellite tagging could help target monitoring efforts to colonies known to use the nGoM, and continued vessel-based observations could improve habitat characterization. As offshore energy development in the nGoM continues, managers and researchers could use these vulnerability ranks to identify information gaps to prioritize research and focal species.},

Organism effects are generally characterized as lethal and sublethal. Sublethal can be short term, long term, or permanent and multigenerational. We present individual examples of effects on behavioral response, olfaction, vision, cardiac function, and gene shift, based on research done in laboratories, mesocosm settings, and the field. Future research should emphasize collection and analysis of routine toxicological baselines and examine how and if molecular impacts cascade up to populations. This research will require development of rapid molecular tools and testing procedures to determine exposure compared to field-relevant exposure levels and to be able to extrapolate laboratory results to the field, especially given the mosaic of differing contaminant concentrations (below, at, or exceeding critical concentrations that result in lethal or sublethal effects) occurring in the environment. Recent chemical studies have identified a detectable suite of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolites for which there are no toxicity data; further research is needed to determine their impacts on food webs.},

  abstract = {The 2010 Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) was the largest and perhaps most consequential accidental marine oil spill in global history. This paper provides an overview of a Research Topic consisting of four additional papers that: (1) assemble time series data for ecosystem components in regions impacted by the spill, and (2) interpret temporal changes related to the vulnerability of species and ecosystems to DWH and the ensuing resilience to perturbation. Time series abundance data for many taxa pre-date DWH, often by decades, thus allowing an assessment of population- and community-level impacts. We divided the north central GoM into four interconnected ``eco-types'': the coastal/nearshore, continental shelf, open-ocean pelagic and deep benthic. Key taxa in each eco-type were evaluated for their vulnerability to the circumstances of the DWH spill based on population overlap with oil, susceptibility to oil contamination, and other factors, as well their imputed resilience to population-level impacts, based on life history metrics, ecology and post-spill trajectories. Each taxon was scored as low, medium, or high for 13 vulnerability attributes and 11 resilience attributes to produce overall vulnerability and resilience scores, which themselves were also categorical (i.e., low, medium, or high). The resulting taxon-specific V-R scores provide important guidance on key species to consider and monitor in the event of future spills similar to DWH. Similar analyses may also guide resource allocation to collect baseline data on highly vulnerable taxa or those with low resilience potential in other ecosystems. For some species, even a decade of observation has been insufficient to document recovery given chronic, long-term exposure to DWH oil remaining in all eco-types and because of impacts to the reproductive output of long-lived species. Due to the ongoing threats of deep-water blowouts, continued surveillance of populations affected by DWH is warranted to document long-term recovery or change in system state. The level of population monitoring in the open-ocean and deep benthic eco-types has historically been low and is inconsistent with the continued migration of the oil industry to the ultra-deep ({$\geq$}1,500 m) where the majority of leasing, exploration, and production now occurs.},

This paper aims to study the planning for the R\&D of RERs in order to avoid bottlenecks and ensure sustainable development in developing marine economies. We have established a triple difference model (DDD) model and a wise pig game model between the theoretical government and enterprise. The data on RERs come from the World Bank and International Energy Agency databases. We have three contributions on the basis of distinguishing between mature and immature marine RERs technologies. First, it emphasizes the importance of developing R\&D planning for marine RERs immature technology in the future. Second, the DDD model is used to empirically establish whether RERs planning has a significant positive impact on RERs' output, which explains the importance of existing RERs planning. Third, the wise pig game model is used to analyze the welfare benefits to the government brought by the R\&D planning of marine RERs which proves the importance of future RERs R\&D planning.}

In the marine environment there is a significant challenge to the production of range maps due to large biases in the amount and location of occurrence data for most species. AquaMaps is compared with traditional presence-only species distribution modelling methods to determine the quality of outputs under equivalently automated conditions. The effect of the inclusion of expert knowledge to AquaMaps is also investigated. Model outputs were tested internally, through data partitioning, and externally against independent survey data to determine the ability of models to predict presence versus absence. Models were also tested externally by assessing correlation with independent survey estimates of relative species abundance. AquaMaps outputs compare well to the existing methods tested, and inclusion of expert knowledge results in a general improvement in model outputs. The transparency, speed and adaptability of the AquaMaps system, as well as the existing online framework which allows expert review to compensate for sampling biases and thus improve model predictions are proposed as additional benefits for public and research use alike.},

  abstract = {This study develops and implements an interdisciplinary framework to provide a holistic examination of the potential for tidal stream turbines (TST) to displace diesel generated electricity in remote coastal First Nations communities in British Columbia. In doing so it seeks to answer the following research questions: what is the distribution of practical tidal resources in the study region, for which communities is tidal energy a potentially viable electricity source, and what are the benefits and challenges of TST development. GIS Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis and interviews with high level marine spatial planning decision makers are used to identify practical resource sites, bridge knowledge gaps, assess views towards TST development, and understand the desired characteristics of community energy systems. Additional techno-economic criteria for tidal site identification are included to identify communities that may be candidates for TST integration. Results illustrate the need for information provision to communities from resource quantification to characteristics of renewable energy technologies; self sufficiency as being the primary electrification driver; and funding/human resource capacity as being substantial barriers to development. Approximately 89.8~km2 of practical tidal resource is identified, with {$\approx$}21.9~km2 of techno-economically feasible practical resource in proximity to nine communities. Four communities appear to be promising candidates for tidal development, and overall results indicate significant interest within the study region for TST development. The interdisciplinary framework presented here provides a methodology that can be adapted and implemented in other jurisdictions to identify practical resources and incorporate social dimensions into MRE decision making.},

However, the collision of birds and bats with wind turbines is widely recognized as a negative environmental impact of wind farms. Collisions with either the static structure or the rotating blades of the wind turbines occur. This project memo provides a review of technology for bird detection and collision prevention, focusing on post-construction minimization measures. Initially, an overview of sensor technologies commonly used to detect birds in the vicinity of wind farms, namely radar and camera-based systems, is presented. Then, four minimization measures including experimental tests at different wind farms worldwide are described: habitat management and painting (categorized as passive measures), and turbine curtailment and deterrents (categorized as active measures, as they require information from an external source to trigger an action for collision avoidance). Advantages and disadvantages of the measures are discussed throughout the document.},

  abstract = {Species and habitats are the subjects of legislation that mandates reporting of information on ecosystem conditions. Improvements in sensors, sampling platforms, information systems, and collaborations among experts and information users now enables more effective and up-to-date information to meet regional and national needs. Specifically, advances in environmental DNA (eDNA)-based assessments of biodiversity, community science data, various underwater imaging devices, and environmental, behavioral, and physiology observations from animal telemetry provide new opportunities to address multiple requirements for reporting status and trends, including insights into life in the deep ocean. Passive and active acoustic sensors help monitor marine life, boat traffic, and noise pollution. Satellites provide repeated, frequent, and long-term records of many relevant variables from global to local scales and, when combined with numerical computer simulations, allow planning for future scenarios. Metadata standards facilitate the transfer of data from machine to machine, thus streamlining assessments and forecasting and providing knowledge directly to the public. The Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) facilitates this exchange of information on life in the sea. The collaborative efforts of the Central and Northern California Ocean Observing System (CeNCOOS) of the US Integrated Ocean Observing System and its partners provide an example of a regional MBON process for information delivery. This includes linking policy and management needs, prioritizing observing data from various platforms and methods, streamlining data handling practices, and delivering information for management such as for the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary and the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem, with iterative process adaptation.},
